9901973,5,"Colour is not proper lavender but its good. The chain is very smooth. I like everything about this sweatshirt. And the inside is very soft. I am usually between M&L but this time i bought L, and it fits me very well. The color is the only cons for me, otherwise everything is perfect.",25 Dec 2020
9901973,4,The hoodie is good. I was expecting colour difference but I got the exact same colour. However the inside portion is the soft fluffy material that bubbles which is a minus point for the quality. I bought this in a sale so I think the price to quality comparison is justified. Overall I am happy with the purchase. It would need layering if you live somewhere where the temparature drops below 16 C.,24 Nov 2021
9901973,3,First of all it's not magenta pink it's like reddish n the chain is bright red which looks weird....overall good for dailywear or at home....n i usually wear M size bt i want a baggy fit so i ordered L size bt L size is so tight that i hv to order XL nd thats still ok in fit.......got it for low price dat's y keeping it ....otherwise nt more than 300 rupees thing....!,26 Dec 2021
9901973,4,This jacket is really soft and comfortable. It's warm too and ideal for light winters. The stitching is good quality but the fibres from the inner lining get stuck to your clothes. I think this might reduce with daily wear and washing. The hood has a nice cotton lining.,29 July 2022

12144158,5,"I had purchased this vibrant sweater from Myntra 2 years ago , and I absolutely love it! The colors are bold and eye-catching, making it perfect for brightening up any winter outfit. The material feels soft and cozy, ensuring warmth during chilly days without feeling too bulky. I also appreciate the fit‚Äîit‚Äôs snug in all the right places but still allows enough room for layering. After a couple of washes, the colors haven't faded, which speaks to the quality. Overall, a fun, stylish addition to my winter wardrobe!",13 Sept 2024
